      <h1>Refund & Cancellation Policy</h1>

      <p>This Refund and Cancellation Policy governs your purchase of digital products from ScoreMAX.</p>

      <h2>1. Digital Product Clause</h2>
      <p>All ScoreMAX offerings are purely digital and are delivered electronically. As per Section 16 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, digital content that is delivered instantly and is non-returnable falls under non-refundable categories.</p>

      <h2>2. No Refunds Policy</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Once a product has been purchased and delivered, no refunds will be provided under any circumstances.</li>
        <li>This applies even if the user fails to download or access the file due to personal technical limitations.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. No Cancellations</h2>
      <p>Orders cannot be cancelled after payment is successfully completed. Since delivery is immediate and automated, cancellation is not operationally possible.</p>

      <h2>4. Duplicate Payments</h2>
      <p>In the unlikely event of duplicate payments, verified excess amounts will be refunded to the original payment method within 7 business days after confirmation.</p>

      <h2>5. Chargebacks and Disputes</h2>
      <p>Initiating a chargeback without contacting us first is considered a breach of our terms. In such cases, we reserve the right to take legal and operational action to protect our rights and services.</p>

      <h2>6. Contact for Dispute Resolution</h2>
      <p>For any billing or payment issues, you may contact us at <strong>scoremax.blueprint@gmail.com</strong>. We will respond within 3 working days.</p>

      <h2>7. Jurisdiction</h2>
      <p>Any refund disputes or legal claims are subject to Indian law and the courts of Bangalore, Karnataka shall have exclusive jurisdiction.</p>
